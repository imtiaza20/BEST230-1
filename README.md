#The program simulates transport of virus particle in cell.
 wedge_transport_class.py has functions which perform diffusive and ballistic steps, and check whether the particle is in diffusive phase or not.
#main_script_pre_model simulates transport according to this paper: PHYSICAL REVIEW E 92, 042709 (2015) 
#main_script_onrate.py simulates the transport accroding to our more realistic model.
#the way to run program "python main_script_onrate.py input.txt"
#input file input.txt has to be places in the folder inputs/
#inputs folder given in repository contains different input files that I used for the project.
#analysis functions can be found in the file plot_class.
