#The program simulates transport of virus particle in cell.

#wedge_transport_class.py has basic functions which perform diffusive and ballistic steps etc.
 
#main_script_pre_model simulates transport according to this paper: PHYSICAL REVIEW E 92, 042709 (2015) 

#main_script_onrate.py simulates the transport accroding to our more realistic model.

#the way to run program "python main_script_onrate.py input.txt N"

#input file input.txt has to be placed in the folder inputs/

#N is the number of cores you would like the program to use.

#inputs folder given in repository contains different input files that I used for the project.

#analysis functions can be found in the file plot_class.
